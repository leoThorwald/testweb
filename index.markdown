        Michael Bay’s Transformers movie franchise once reigned in the box office for four movies in a row while barely having gotten more than 60% in Rotten Tomatoes before finally being struck down in the form of a flop. Still, its sheer staying power for an entire decade practically redefined what Hollywood juggernauts, even those that were never particularly critic darlings, can do. Fast forward 7 years later, and Transformers One, despite enjoying a rave 89% Rotten Tomatoes, made barely enough to break even production and marketing wise.

        The sheer disparity between various films in what amounts to the same cinematic arena presents a curious paradox: which factors decide such things? How can a series that critics gleefully dismantle—often with the precision of a Decepticon going after a power grid—still rake in billions at the box office; while films showered with praise, poetic dialogue, and teary-eyed festival audiences sometimes limp away from theaters with barely enough profit to buy popcorn? This baffling divide between critical acclaim and financial success in cinema isn't just a case of art versus commerce—it’s a fascinating puzzle of audience expectations, marketing muscle, and the ever-mysterious “X factor” that drives people to theaters (or keeps them away).

        With this data analysis story, we aim to explore – and hopefully reveal – the hidden mechanics behind why some films soar financially despite scathing, or at least middling, reviews, while others praised as modern masterpieces fade into relative box office oblivion. It can be hidden in the overall way the plot shifts, the degree it fluctuates, the way the plot might’ve leaned too much or little into one emotion, or the blessing (or curse) of certain star power. This is the story about the outliers, the films that refuse to conform to the average data analyst’ neat linear regression models. Let’s untangle the reels and find out.
